## Notes - Challenges while building this
Building the Creatorverse app presented several challenges. Ensuring a responsive design for the content creator cards was tricky, particularly getting them to display three per row and centering a single card when fewer were present. Implementing smooth scrolling between sections required careful integration of JavaScript with React's state management for a seamless user experience.

Managing multiple background images and ensuring they displayed correctly across various screen sizes was another hurdle. Designing the form for adding new content creators posed challenges in maintaining both functionality and aesthetics, especially on different devices.

Integrating with Supabase for backend data storage required robust error handling and careful attention to data security. Throughout development, the focus remained on creating an intuitive user experience, with iterative improvements ensuring the app was both functional and user-friendly.

This project was a learning journey, requiring adaptation to new challenges in responsive design, backend integration, and user interface design.
